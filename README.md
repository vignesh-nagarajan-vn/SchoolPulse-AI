# SchoolPulse AI

SchoolPulse AI is a suite of three independent AI tools: **Aqualert AI** (Water Usage), **Compost AI** (Food Waste) and **Pulse AI Agent** (Energy Loss) that helps schools visualize their entire environmental footprint on a unified web dashboard and delivers actionable steps for a school administration to take in order to reduce their substantially environmental footprint through an ElevenLabs voice agent. School Pulse AI was built for the USAII Global AI Hackathon 2026.

## Architecture

The SchoolPulse AI collects real data from the readings of Aqualert AI (`water_logs.csv`) and Compost AI (`waste_logs.csv`). It then uses syntehtic data to populate the data for energy consumption within a school (`energy_logs.csv`).  The backend collapses every signal into one comprehensive overview and the dashboard renders it as prioritized action cards with instructions school administration members should follow. The school can also query the voice agent about any questions they have regarding the school's environmental footprint and how they can reduce it. The voice agent uses TF-IDF RAG to query the databses based on `term_frequency` and `inverse_document_frequency` before responding to the users question.

The system is resilient by design, with **two independent fallback layers** so a the website always renders a message to the user.

1. **Backend fallback.** When no GPU or LLM endpoint is configured, `PulseAgent` skips the model and composes a deterministic answer directly from simple data analytics queries on the databases using SQLite.
2. **Frontend fallback.** Every browser call to `/api/*` is wrapped, which means on any failure the dashboard falls back to bundled synthetic JSON in `web/lib/fallback/`, so the charts and tables still populate with the backend fully offline.

## Aqualert AI (Water Usage)

Aqualert AI detects toilet leaks from the water level inside the tank. It runs a ***linear regression model*** on data collected from an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. Specifically, the ultrasonic sensor echose 7 times every 60 seconds, which collects distance measurements of the water level in the tank. It then plots each data point on a graph and draws a line of best fit using linear regression. If the water level decline (linear regression line of best fit) is below the set threshold, the model determines the toilet is leaking and sends an alert to the dashboard, which appears as a High Action Priority Card.

### System Design 
**A. Sensing.** An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor powered by a Raspberry Pi 0 measures the distance to the water surface and streams the readings over a USB serial at `115200 baud` as JSON lines, which a bridge forwards to the live csv file, which is then populated onto the database. 

**B. Measurement.** Each cycle takes **7 rapid samples** and rejects outliers with a MAD-based modified z-score, then plots a line of best fit using linear regression

**C. Detection.** A leaking tank shows a slow sawtooth: the level creeps down between flushes, and the fill valve periodically tops it back up. The detector unwraps those micro-refills into the underlying decline and feeds the result to a state machine.

**D. Telemetry.** Every decision ships over MQTT with TLS, with a REST and SQLite store-and-forward fallback so nothing is lost.

A leak is flagged only when the **upper** bound of the slope CI clears the threshold, which keeps false alarms rare, and during occupied hours a decline must sustain for **3 consecutive windows** before escalating.

| State | Meaning |
| -------- | -------- |
| `NORMAL` | Level is stable, no action needed. |
| `WATCH` | A weak but real decline is forming, monitoring continues. |
| `LEAK_SUSPECTED` | The conservative threshold cleared with corroborating evidence. |
| `SENSOR_FAULT` | Too few valid echoes to report safely. |

Each alert carries a per-day wasted-water estimate as a range, derived from the slope CI:

```json
{
  "device_id": "aqualert-dev-001",
  "state": "LEAK_SUSPECTED",
  "confidence": 0.94
}
```

## Compost AI (Food)

Compost AI is a smart-bin classifier that sorts waste into either `garbage` or `compost` at the moment of disposal. Once a user throws away an item of waste, an ultrasonic sensor detects its presence and sends a signal to the processing unit to take a picture. The processing unit is a dashboard open on an iPad. The iPad rear-view camera takes a picture of the item and runs inference on a deep convolutional neural network (EfficientNet-B0 backbone). After the neural network determines which bin the item should be sorted into, a signal is sent to the servo motor to move 60 degrees left if the item is compost or 60 degrees right if the item is classified as garbage. Finally in the dashboard, the user has the option to correct the model if it was wrong using a **reinforcement learning** technique called correction memory, so the model never makes the same mistake twice. 

- **Software:** A CNN that can take an image of the waste items as input and determine if it belongs in either the garbage, recycling and compost.

- **Hardware:** A Raspberry Pi 4 to run model inference + camera module capture images of the inputted waste item + a container with three bins to hold sorted waste +ultrasonic sensor to detect when bin is full + 3 servo motors.

### Classification Pipeline

An **EfficientNet-B0** backbone with ImageNet transfer learning is fine-tuned on **224x224** images. The frozen backbone feeds a trainable head with a 256-unit dense layer, L2 regularization, dropout, and a softmax over **30 waste classes**. Training uses the [Recyclable and Household Waste Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification) dataset on Kaggle: **15,000+ images**, **500 per class**, split across studio-style and real-world photos.

The model predicts a fine-grained class, then maps it to a disposal pathway. The headline number is the metric that actually matters for sorting:

| Metric | Score |
| -------- | -------- |
| Disposal-pathway adjusted accuracy (3-way) | **96.36%** |
| Fine-grained accuracy (30-way) | **87.60%** |
| Quantized TFLite for deployment | **~92%** |

Predictions below a **0.65** confidence threshold are flagged in the dashboard for a human reviewer, and a Grad-CAM overlay shows which pixels drove the decision. Finally a reinforcment agent takes feedback from the user and stores that feedback into memory. After multiple iterations, the agent is trained to fix its mistakes on items it commonly misidentifies.

## Pulse Agent AI (Energy and Operations)

Pulse Agent is the brain and the dashboard. It reads schedules, energy logs, water alerts, and Compost AI outputs, finds the waste, and explains it in plain language a custodian or principal can act on.

### Reasoning Pipeline

Synthetic or real logs load into **SQLite**, and the project context and research sources are indexed into a **TF-IDF** matrix persisted with joblib. On a question, `RagRetriever` pulls the top matching context by cosine similarity, `AnalyticsService.overview()` computes impact totals and ranks action cards, and `PulseAgent` fuses both into an answer. If `LLM_BASE_URL` points at an OpenAI-compatible **Gemma** endpoint the agent uses it, otherwise it falls back to a deterministic, fully offline response. Every answer carries a confidence and an explicit human-verification step, and the agent never orders a purchase, repair, or schedule change on its own.

The voice agent speaks and listens in **6 languages**: English, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, and French, using ElevenLabs when configured and the browser Web Speech API otherwise.

The dashboard needs only a handful of endpoints:

| Endpoint | Returns |
| -------- | -------- |
| `GET /api/overview` | Impact totals plus the top ranked action cards. |
| `GET /api/energy` `GET /api/water` `GET /api/waste` | Per-module summaries. |
| `GET /api/water/live` `GET /api/waste/live` | Live sensor feeds for the leak and sort tables. |
| `GET /api/events` `GET /api/event-plan` | Event history and a forecasted plan for an upcoming event. |
| `POST /api/agent/query` | A grounded agent answer with action cards and citations. |
| `POST /api/voice/speak` | Synthesized speech for the answer. |

### Features

1. **Unified footprint dashboard.** Water, food, and energy waste in one black-and-white interface, with red reserved strictly for critical alerts.
2. **Voice agent.** Google Gemini VoiceAgent built on top of Gemna and ElevelLabs API
3. **Human-checkable action cards.** Every insight ships with evidence, a confidence score, an estimated impact, and the exact human verification step before anyone acts.
4. **Live edge feeds.** The water and food tables poll the real sensor endpoints and surface new leaks and low-confidence sorts as they arrive.
5. **Event forecasting.** Estimate servings, energy, and waste for an upcoming event from past event history.
6. **Offline-resilient by default.** Layered backend and frontend fallbacks keep the whole experience working with no GPU and no backend at all.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** for the Pulse Agent backend, Aqualert, and the Compost notebook. https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **Node.js 18+** for the Next.js dashboard. https://nodejs.org/
- **A CUDA GPU (optional)** to run Gemma behind an OpenAI-compatible server or to retrain the Compost model. CPU paths work without it.

1. **Run the Pulse Agent backend.** Build the data, index, and database once, then serve the API on port 8000, which is the port the dashboard proxies to by default.

   ```bash
   cd pulse-agent-ai
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   python scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py
   python scripts/init_db.py
   python scripts/build_rag_index.py
   python scripts/train_models.py

   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Run the web dashboard.** It proxies `/api/*` to the backend from step 1.

   ```bash
   cd pulse-agent-ai/web
   npm install
   npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
   ```

   To regenerate the offline fallback data after changing the synthetic logs:

   ```bash
   npm run gen:fallback
   ```

3. **Simulate Aqualert.** No hardware and no config file are required for simulation.

   ```bash
   cd aqualert-ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python scripts/simulate.py --scenario leak_slow --json   # also: normal, leak_fast, sensor_fault
   python -m pytest                                          # run the detector and telemetry tests
   ```

4. **Run or retrain Compost AI.** Open the notebook and run all cells, or serve the inference API directly.

   ```bash
   # Notebook: Compost-AI/Compost AI (EfficientNetB0 ~96% Accuracy).ipynb
   cd Compost-AI/inference
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app:app --reload         # FastAPI inference service with Grad-CAM
   ```

5. **Enable Gemma (optional).** Point the agent at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint and restart the backend. Everything else stays the same.

   ```bash
   export LLM_BASE_URL="http://YOUR_GPU_IP:8000/v1"
   export LLM_MODEL="google/gemma-4-12B-it"
   export LLM_API_KEY="EMPTY"
   ```
