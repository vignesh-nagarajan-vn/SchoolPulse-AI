## Summary
Aqualert AI is an edge-AI leak detector designed to flag running or leaking toilets in school bathrooms before significant water waste occurs. It is a component of **SchoolPulse AI**, which is a suite of edge AI tools designed to help reduce a school's environmental footprint. This directory contains the source code, server, simulation scripts, and tests for the Aqualert AI detection pipeline.

### Problem
***[A single running toilet can waste up to 200 gallons of water per day](https://www.epa.gov/watersense/fix-a-leak-week)*** — silently, invisibly, and often for weeks before anyone notices. In a school with dozens of bathrooms, a worn flapper or fill valve that won't fully seat can drain tens of thousands of gallons a year. The problem is that:

1. Leaks are invisible from the outside — you can't see or hear a slow running toilet, so they go unreported until a water bill arrives months later

2. Schools lack any automated monitoring of toilet water usage, meaning maintenance staff only learn about leaks when the damage is already done

### Solution
An edge-AI device that watches a tank-type toilet continuously and flags a running or leaking toilet before it wastes hundreds of gallons. The device mounts a Raspberry Pi with an ultrasonic sensor on the tank lid, decides locally whether there is a leak — with an explicit confidence score and error margin — and ships that verdict to a server. It is **advisory only**: it never shuts off water or takes any irreversible action.

- **Software:** A statistical detection pipeline (OLS regression + confidence intervals + a state machine) that reads water level over time and identifies the slow sawtooth pattern characteristic of a leaking flapper.

- **Hardware:** A Raspberry Pi Zero with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on the tank lid, facing down at the water surface.

The entire pipeline runs **end to end in simulation with zero hardware**, so you can evaluate it on a laptop.

## Detection Pipeline (Software)

Level is `L = mount_height_cm − measured_distance_cm` (water rising shortens the echo distance). A healthy tank holds a flat line between flushes. A leaking tank shows a slow **sawtooth**: the level creeps down as water seeps into the bowl, and the fill valve periodically tops it back up (a *micro-refill*).

### How Detection Works

1. **Measurement** — each cycle takes 7 rapid samples, rejects outliers with a MAD modified-z-score, and reports the mean level with a Student's-t 95% confidence interval. Too few valid echoes → `SENSOR_FAULT` (never a guess); a churning surface (high spread) → `TURBULENT` and the sample is skipped.

2. **Trend Analysis** — over a rolling window the detector classifies discrete steps (flushes, micro-refills, flush recoveries) and *unwraps* them, turning the sawtooth into the underlying slow decline. It then OLS-fits level vs time and reports the **slope and its confidence interval**.

3. **Decision** — a leak is flagged only when the *upper* bound of the slope CI is below a negative rate threshold (real beyond noise **and** big enough to matter), corroborated by refill count. A weak-but-real decline is never dropped silently — it surfaces as `WATCH`. Overnight (idle window) evidence is high confidence; daytime evidence must sustain across windows first.

4. **Impact** — the decline-rate CI is converted to an estimated **gallons/day** wasted, reported as a range.

### Detection States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NORMAL` | Water level is stable, no leak detected |
| `WATCH` | Weak but real decline detected — monitoring continues |
| `LEAK_SUSPECTED` | Conservative threshold cleared with corroborating evidence |
| `SENSOR_FAULT` | Too few valid echoes to report — never a fabricated value |

Every detection carries a full numeric reasoning trace (slope, CI, confidence, estimated waste).

## Aqualert AI Hardware

### Wiring (HC-SR04 → Raspberry Pi)

| HC-SR04 | Pi Pin | GPIO (BCM) | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| VCC | Pin 2 | 5V | sensor needs 5V |
| GND | Pin 6 | GND | common ground |
| Trig | Pin 16 | GPIO23 | 3.3V trigger, direct |
| Echo | Pin 18 | GPIO24 | **through a 1k/2k voltage divider** (5V → 3.3V) |

The Pi's GPIO is **not** 5V-tolerant. The Echo line *must* go through a voltage divider (e.g. 1 kΩ in series, 2 kΩ to ground) to drop the 5V echo to ~3.3V. Mount the sensor on the tank lid facing straight down at the water surface, with a clear path and no obstruction from the fill/flush hardware.

### Install

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt          # laptop / server
# On the Raspberry Pi also install the GPIO backends:
python -m pip install gpiozero RPi.GPIO
```

`gpiozero` / `RPi.GPIO` are intentionally **not** hard dependencies — they are imported lazily only by the real driver, so everything imports and runs in simulation on a machine with no GPIO.

### Configure

Copy the template and edit:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Credentials are **never** stored in the file. Export them as environment variables:

```bash
export AQUALERT_MQTT_USERNAME=...   # MQTT broker user
export AQUALERT_MQTT_PASSWORD=...   # MQTT broker password
export AQUALERT_REST_TOKEN=...      # bearer token for the REST fallback
```

### Usage

**Calibrate on the Pi** (full, settled tank):

```bash
python scripts/calibrate.py --config config.yaml --empty   # empty tank: mount height
python scripts/calibrate.py --config config.yaml           # full tank: full line
```

**Run on the Pi** (real sensor — set `sensor.mode: real` in config):

```bash
python -m aqualert.runner --config config.yaml
```

**Run in simulation** (no hardware needed):

```bash
python scripts/simulate.py --scenario normal
python scripts/simulate.py --scenario leak_slow --json
python scripts/simulate.py --scenario leak_fast
python scripts/simulate.py --scenario sensor_fault
```

**Run the server** (MQTT subscriber + JSON read API):

```bash
python server/receiver.py --config config.yaml --db telemetry.sqlite
# Read endpoints:
#   GET /health
#   GET /devices/<device_id>/latest
#   GET /devices/<device_id>/history?limit=100
# (use --no-mqtt to run only the read API)
```

**Push live Arduino readings to the Vercel dashboard**:

The repo also includes a lightweight USB-serial bridge for the separate `aqualert-frontend/` Next.js app. The current Arduino UNO sketch prints JSON lines over Serial at `115200` baud, and `scripts/serial_reader.py` forwards those readings to the frontend's `POST /api/ingest` endpoint.

```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
cp scripts/.env.example scripts/.env
# set VERCEL_INGEST_URL=https://<your-vercel-app>/api/ingest
# set INGEST_SECRET to match the Vercel environment variable
python scripts/serial_reader.py
```

The Vercel page polls `GET /api/latest` every 2 seconds and renders the newest reading plus recent history from Vercel KV.

**Run the tests:**

```bash
python -m pytest
```

### Telemetry Payload

Each message has a `msg_id`. The device persists every message to a local SQLite spool and forwards oldest-first; the server upserts on `msg_id`, so at-least-once delivery survives outages with **no loss and no duplicates**.

```json
{
  "msg_id": "f3a1...",
  "device_id": "aqualert-dev-001",
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-01T07:30:00+00:00",
  "level_cm": 17.4,
  "level_ci": [17.31, 17.49],
  "state": "LEAK_SUSPECTED",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "slope_cm_per_hr": -1.23,
  "slope_ci": [-1.31, -1.15],
  "refill_events": 3,
  "est_waste_gpd": [6.5, 7.1],
  "config_version": "1.0.0",
  "firmware_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Responsible AI

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **False alarm** annoys staff, erodes trust | Conservative two-sided gate (flag only when the *upper* slope-CI bound clears the threshold); daytime trends must sustain across 3 windows; every alert ships its confidence + CI |
| **Missed leak** wastes water | Weak-but-real declines are surfaced as `WATCH`, never dropped; refill evidence corroborates the slope |
| **Acting on a broken sensor** | Insufficient or invalid echoes return `SENSOR_FAULT` — a value is never fabricated; turbulence is skipped, not guessed |
| **Over-automation** | The device is **advisory only**. It never closes a valve or shuts off water. A human reviews alerts and decides. |
| **Privacy / overreach** | It measures only tank water level — no audio, no images, no occupancy tracking |
| **Credential leakage** | Secrets come from environment variables only; none are stored in code or config |

Confidence is a calibrated signal to a human, not a license to act autonomously. When in doubt the system says so (`WATCH`, `SENSOR_FAULT`) rather than overclaiming.
